# **Word2Vec Analysis and Applications**

This repository contains an in-depth exploration of **Word2Vec**, a popular model in NLP for representing words as vectors. The project demonstrates the practical and theoretical aspects of Word2Vec using Jupyter Notebook examples and detailed explanations.

### **Notebook Overview**
The accompanying Jupyter Notebook provides:
- Practical demonstrations of Word2Vec's functionality.
- Examples of `similarity()`, `most_similar()`, `doesnt_match()`, and other Gensim functions.
- Visualization of word relationships using **PCA** and **t-SNE**.
- Arithmetic operations on word vectors (e.g., `king - man + woman = queen`).

You can find the Notebook [here](notebooks/word2vec_analysis.ipynb).
